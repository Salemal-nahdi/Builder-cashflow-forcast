# Database & Authentication Status

## Current Status ✅

**Database:** Fully functional and properly configured
- ✅ All tables exist and are accessible  
- ✅ Connection working correctly
- ✅ Neon PostgreSQL database configured

**Authentication:** Configuration issues
- ❌ "Connection closed" errors during page load
- ⚠️ NextAuth needs SessionProvider wrapper
- ⚠️ Missing demo user in database

## Error Details
```
User `username` was denied access on the database `builder_forecasting.public`
```

This indicates that the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable in Netlify is still using placeholder values from the example file.

## Solution

### 1. Set up a PostgreSQL Database
You need to set up a PostgreSQL database. Options include:
- **Supabase** (recommended - free tier available)
- **Neon** (free tier available)
- **Railway** (free tier available)
- **PlanetScale** (MySQL, but can work with Prisma)

### 2. Configure Netlify Environment Variables
In your Netlify dashboard, go to:
1. Site Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add/Update the following variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://[real-username]:[real-password]@[host]:[port]/[database-name]
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://builder-cashflow-forcast.netlify.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=[generate-a-random-secret]
```

### 3. Example with Supabase
If using Supabase:
1. Create a new project
2. Go to Settings → Database
3. Copy the connection string
4. It will look like:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.[project-ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres
```

### 4. Run Database Migrations
After setting up the database, the app will automatically run migrations on the next deployment.

## Quick Test
Once the database is configured, you can test the connection at:
https://builder-cashflow-forcast.netlify.app/api/health/database

It should return:
```json
{"status":"healthy","database":"connected","timestamp":"..."}
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Application code is working
- ✅ Error handling is improved
- ❌ Database credentials need to be configured
- ❌ Database needs to be set up and accessible

Once the database is properly configured, the "Connection closed" errors should be resolved.

# 🎉 Builder Forecasting Software - Enhanced Interactive Demo

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. **Flexible Payment Timing Model**
The demo now supports sophisticated payment scheduling with costs paid before or after income receipts:

#### **Simple Cost Model**
- Single cost amount per milestone
- Configurable payment offset (days relative to income date)
- Preset options:
  - 30 days before income
  - 14 days before income
  - 7 days before income
  - Same day as income
  - 7 days after income
  - 14 days after income
  - 30 days after income
  - 60 days after income

#### **Real-World Examples Included**
```
Project: Residential Complex - Phase 1
├─ Foundation Complete (Feb)
   ├─ Income: $150,000 on Feb 28
   ├─ Costs: $120,000 paid Feb 14 (-14 days)
   └─ Realistic timing: Materials purchased before payment received

├─ Frame & Roof (Mar)  
   ├─ Income: $200,000 on Mar 31
   ├─ Timber: $80,000 paid Mar 24 (-7 days)
   ├─ Roofing: $50,000 paid Mar 31 (same day)
   └─ Labor: $30,000 paid Apr 7 (+7 days)

├─ Interior Rough-in (Apr)
   ├─ Income: $180,000 on Apr 30
   ├─ Costs: $140,000 paid May 7 (+7 days)
   └─ Payment terms modeled: Net 7
```

### 2. **Add New Projects Functionality**

- Real-time forecast updates when projects are added

#### **Smart Project Templates**
Three pre-configured templates with realistic milestone structures:

**Residential Construction**
- 5 milestones: Site Prep → Framing → Rough-in → Finishing → Completion
- Typical payment distributions: 20%, 25%, 20%, 25%, 10%
- Realistic cost payment offsets

**Commercial Construction**
- 5 milestones: Site Work → Foundation → M&E → Interior → Commissioning
- Payment distribution: 10%, 35%, 25%, 20%, 10%
- Longer payment terms (up to 30 days)

**Renovation/Remodel**
- 4 milestones: Demolition → Structural → Systems → Finishes
- Payment distribution: 15%, 30%, 25%, 30%
- Varied payment timing

#### **Project Configuration Options**

### 4. **Enhanced Cashflow Calculation Engine**

#### **True Cashflow Timing**
The forecast now accurately models:
- Income events on milestone completion dates
- Cost events on their actual payment dates (which can be before or after income)
- Monthly overhead allocation
- Running balance that reflects true cash position

#### **Cash Events System**
```typescript
cashEvents = [
  // Income when milestone completed
  { date: Mar 31, type: 'income', amount: $200,000, description: 'Frame & Roof' }
  
  // Costs paid on various dates
  { date: Mar 24, type: 'cost', amount: $80,000, description: 'Timber (-7 days)' }
  { date: Mar 31, type: 'cost', amount: $50,000, description: 'Roofing (same day)' }
  { date: Apr 7, type: 'cost', amount: $30,000, description: 'Labor (+7 days)' }
]
```

### 5. **Realistic Demo Data**

#### **Project 1: Residential Complex** (75% complete)
- 5 milestones with mixed payment timing
- Demonstrates both early payments (materials) and late payments (labor)
- Shows completed, in-progress, and pending milestones

#### **Project 2: Commercial Office Building** (25% complete)
- Larger scale project ($1.2M)
- Longer payment terms (up to 30 days)
- Mix of simple and detailed cost models

#### **Project 3: School Renovation** (90% complete)
- Nearly complete project
- Consistent payment pattern (+7 days)
- Demonstrates completed project lifecycle

## 🚀 How to Use the Enhanced Demo

### Adding a New Project
1. Click the **"Add Project"** button (top right of Projects section)
2. Enter project details:
   - Name (or use default based on type)
   - Select project type (Residential/Commercial/Renovation)
   - Set contract value
   - Choose duration in months
   - Pick start date
3. Enable "Auto-generate Milestones" for realistic structure
4. Review the milestone preview
5. Click "Add Project"
6. Watch the forecast update automatically!

### Editing Payment Timing
1. Click **"Edit Payments & Costs"** on any project card
2. For each milestone:
   - Adjust income amount
   - Modify cost amount
   - **Select payment timing** from dropdown
     - Choose how many days before/after income the costs are paid
     - Simulates real supplier payment terms
3. See real-time margin calculations
4. Click "Save All Changes"
5. Forecast updates to show true cash timing!

### Understanding Payment Offsets
- **Negative offsets** (e.g., -14 days): Costs paid BEFORE receiving income
  - Typical for: Material deposits, upfront supplier payments
  - Impact: Temporary negative cashflow, needs working capital
  
- **Zero offset** (same day): Costs and income occur together
  - Typical for: Cash jobs, quick turnaround projects
  - Impact: Neutral cashflow timing
  
- **Positive offsets** (e.g., +30 days): Costs paid AFTER receiving income  
  - Typical for: Net 30 terms, labor payments, subcontractors
  - Impact: Positive cashflow buffer, improves working capital

### Testing Scenarios
1. **Working Capital Crunch**
   - Add a large project with -30 day payment offsets
   - See how paying suppliers before receiving payment affects cash balance
   
2. **Improved Terms Negotiation**
   - Edit Commercial Office Building
   - Change payment offsets from -14 to +30 days
   - Watch cashflow improve dramatically

3. **Mixed Payment Terms**
   - Create new project
   - Set different offsets for each milestone
   - Model realistic construction project cash timing

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Data Model
```typescript
interface Milestone {
  id: string
  name: string
  month: number                    // When milestone occurs
  incomeAmount: number             // Payment received
  status: 'completed' | 'in-progress' | 'pending'
  usesSimpleCost: boolean          // Simple vs detailed cost model
  costAmount?: number              // Total costs
  costPaymentOffset?: number       // Days from income date (can be negative)
  costItems?: CostItem[]           // Alternative: detailed breakdown
}

interface CostItem {
  id: string
  description: string
  amount: number
  vendor?: string
  paymentOffset: number            // Days from milestone income date
  status: 'pending' | 'paid'
}
```

### Forecast Calculation
```typescript
// For each milestone
const incomeDate = startDate + milestone.month
const costDate = incomeDate + milestone.costPaymentOffset

// Creates cash events
cashEvents.push({
  date: incomeDate,
  type: 'income',
  amount: milestone.incomeAmount
})

cashEvents.push({
  date: costDate,  // Different from income date!
  type: 'cost',
  amount: milestone.costAmount
})

// Then aggregate by month for chart display
```
